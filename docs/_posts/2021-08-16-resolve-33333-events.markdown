  Resolve issues detected with SCOM Event ID 33333 which can occur on any Management Server.

 I had a case recently where my customer was having issues with the following Event ID 33333 on all the Management Servers in the Management Group.
 
 This is the Exact Event Information:
```
Log Name:      Operations Manager
Source:        DataAccessLayer
Date:          7/7/2021 2:19:52 PM
Event ID:      33333
Task Category: None
Level:         Warning
Keywords:      Classic
User:          N/A
Computer:      ManagementServer1.contoso.com
Description:
Data Access Layer rejected retry on SqlError:
 Request: p_StateChangeEventProcess -- (BaseManagedEntityId=2ee6ce9a-6ec1-4a16-335b-700136600z60), (EventOriginId=b48055d3-18f2-40f7-a0e7-a0f8bd1b44a3), (MonitorId=f1baeb56-8cce-f8c7-79ae-d69796c9d926), (NewHealthState=3), (OldHealthState=1), (TimeGenerated=7/7/2021 6:19:43 PM), (Context=), (RETURN_VALUE=0)
 Class: 14
 Number: 2627
 Message: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_StateChangeEvent'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.StateChangeEvent'. The duplicate key value is (b48055d3-18f2-40f7-a0e7-a0f8bd1b44a3).
```

This Powershell Script will allow you to detect for Event ID 33333 being generated and get a count of unique Servers referenced across your OperationsManager Event Log:
```powershell
$events = (Get-EventLog -LogName 'Operations Manager' -Source 'DataAccessLayer' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.EventID -eq 33333 })
# If Event 33333 found in the OperationsManager Event Log, do the below
if (($events.Message -like "*Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_StateChangeEvent'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.StateChangeEvent'. The duplicate key value is*") -and ($events.Message -like "*f1baeb56-8cce-f8c7-79ae-d69796c9d926*"))
	{
		$message = $events | %{ ($_ | Select-Object -Property Message -ExpandProperty Message) }
		$matches = $message -split "," | select-string "MonitorId=(.*)"
		$match = $matches.matches.groups[1].value.TrimEnd(")")
		$i++
		$i = $i
		"Found $($message.count) issues with the Event ID 33333 (Monitor Id: $match), see the following article:`n   https://kevinholman.com/2017/05/29/stop-healthservice-restarts-in-scom-2016/"
	}
```

Run the above script on each of your Management Servers in your Management Group.

I found that this correlates to this article written by Kevin Holman:

Following the steps in the article above, will resolve the issues you are having with Event ID: **33333** `Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_StateChangeEvent'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.StateChangeEvent'.` .
